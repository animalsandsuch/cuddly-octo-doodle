			<p>War has happened many times in your life and armies always need someone to fight, someone to help save troops that are wounded and somebody to pray with them. Your family's history has inspired you into learning the medical field and combat. You trained as a youth, studied survival techniques, studied the use of weapons and armor, and studied ways of keeping people alive. You might have been a medic for an army or a freelancer medic for mercenary companies. You're primarily responsible for providing emergency medical treatment, protection, and evacuation from a point of injury or illness. You help keep your comrades alive and fight off the enemies as well. Not only do you keep your comrades alive but you take care of them after injury and help boost moral by keeping them company, hearing their worries and giving them telling them inspirational stories from religious scripts.</p>

			<p>You are a medical soldier and spiritual advisor, who heals the heart mind and body. Did you extract arrows or prepare healing herbal brews? Were you sent out onto a battlefield to retrieve wounded soldiers? Perhaps you had to fight to defend yourself. Either way, both sides respect and take comfort when they see your distinctive uniform coming over the battlefield towards them. Wherever you go, you are welcomed. Soldiers of all ranks and villagers alike will come to you with their wounds, illnesses, and to seek spiritual guidance (as long as they have a similar alignment or values). If you help others, they will help you; this will provide you with contacts and allies others don't have.</p>
